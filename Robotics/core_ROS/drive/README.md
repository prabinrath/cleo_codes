# Shape following bot
An autonomous bot that can physically follow some typical shapes infront of it in white background.
ROS packages drive_pub,checkdata and Serialport for arduino

alternative launch the drive.launch

In the configuration set these parameters simultaniously
	set_HSV 	set_sahpe
	1(blue)		triangle
	2(pink)		square
	3(green)	pentagon
	4(brown)	hexagon
